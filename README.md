# XIP

## Description

XIP generates a list of IP addresses by applying a set of transformations used to bypass security measures e.g. blacklist filtering, WAF, etc.

## Usage

```bash
python3 xip.py --help
```

## Docker alternative

### Official image

You can pull the official Drupwn image from the dockerhub registry using the following command:

```
docker pull immunit/XIP
```

### Build

To build the container, just use this command:

```bash
docker build -t xip .
```

Docker will download the Alpine image and then execute the installation steps.

> Be patient, the process can be quite long the first time.

### Run

Once the build process is over, get and enjoy your new tool.

```bash
docker run --rm -it xip --help
```

## Logging

The output generated is stored in the **/tmp/** folder.
When using docker, run your container using the following option

```bash
-v YOUR_PATH_FOLDER:/tmp/
```
